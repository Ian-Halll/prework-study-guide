# Ian's Website

## Description
When building this site, my main goal was to improve my undertstanding of Javascript, CSS, and HTML, as well as using Git.
I built this project to become more comfortable with using multiple languages in conjunction to construct a website.
I learned to use CSS to implement an external style sheet, how to provide interactivity using JavaScript, and how to use HTML as a framework for a project.
